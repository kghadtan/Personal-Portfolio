                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I am a 3rd year BSc Electrical Engineering student at TU/e with a strong passion for technology and innovation. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience as a Teaching and Technical Assistant in Hardware and Software Integration, where I have honed my skills in both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering.
 I am eager to contribute to projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities and expand my knowledge in the field.</p>

                            <h3>Machine Learning Project - Towards Neural Networks @ TU/e</h3>
                            <p>Python assignment using Anaconda Navigator (Jupyter Lab) with TensorFlow and Keras to build a handwritten digit recognizer. The tasks include using (stochastic) gradient descent for convex optimization and solving linear systems, explaining why (stochastic) gradient descent is beneficial for large models, evaluating model performance and the impact of learning rates, applying gradient descent to linear regression and classification, optimizing models with Keras while managing complexity and identifying under- or overfitting, selecting appropriate activation functions, splitting data into training and test sets, and applying techniques to improve overall model performance.</p>

                            <h3>Programming Engineering Challenge @ TU/e</h3>
                            <p>Investigate the feasibility of the development of an ’intelligent’ baby cradle. This device should search, based on a limited number of input parameters, for a rocking pattern that ensures that the baby’s heart rhythm quickly recovers and the crying stops. A first order approximation is to control, based on input signals (crying intensity and heart rate), an electrically powered cradle seat, which contains a prepared baby doll. The idea is that based on the above parameters the two-dimensional array of rocking amplitude and frequency is investigated. Working in a team of 5 members, we designed the optimal baby cradle using analog circuits, PWM signals, Arduino headers, C programming and UART protocol to send signals between modules. 

Improved skills in C programming, design skills in creating sensors (Heartbeat, crying sound), and optimizing the circuit by using filters and amplifiers. Gained familiarity with PYNQ board, and used signals in order to drive power through a transistor circuit in order to control actuator movements of the cradle.</p>

                            <h3>Multidisiplinary CBL: Artifically Structure your Biosensor</h3>
                            <p>In collaboration with Biomedicine, Physics and Electrical Engineering students, this project focuses on developing a THz-based biosensor using metamaterials to enhance detection of cancer cells. Traditional THz sensing is limited due to the inability to excite surface plasmons on metals, but by designing subwavelength structures—specifically C-shaped Split Ring Resonators (SRRs)—we can enhance local electric fields and improve sensitivity. The sensor is being fabricated using laser-based techniques. I am currently working on creating specifications for our design and simulating SRR structures..</p>
